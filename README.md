# Task

## Question:-

Pick any particular questions on stackoverflow, and re-implement the page in React. The site will have to be an SPA, and will have to be responsive. The buttons should be click-able and respond to it. The page does not need to store the state in any backend, but a simple, hard-coded backend for the login page is required in order to access the question page. The front end should send the request to the backend, where a simple, hard-coded validation is done, and should accordingly show an error message or show the question page. The backend should be implemented in NodeJS and express. Send us the link to the GitHub repo
## How to Run the Code:-

1. Go to the project and run the command <br> ```npm install```
2. Now run the command <br> ```npm start```
3. Now in a new terminal go to the frontend folder and run the command <br> ```npm install```
4. Now run the command <br> ```npm start```
